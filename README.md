# Project Submission ReadMe

Welcome to my project submission! This application is built on a MERN stack, comprising MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. The choice of MERN stack facilitates seamless integration between the UI and the API.

## Running the Application

To run this application, please refer to the individual ReadMe files in each service, namely the UI and the API.

## Why MERN?

I opted for the MERN stack primarily for its ease of integration and the flexibility it provides. MongoDB, a NoSQL database used in this project, allows for agile schema changes, making it efficient to add new attributes to objects.

## Feature Implementation: Collaboration on Projects

While the current project focuses on project creation and storage, future iterations could include collaboration features. Here are steps to implement collaboration:

1. **User Roles and Permissions:**

   - Define roles like "Owner," "Collaborator," and "Viewer."
   - Owners have full control, collaborators can edit, and viewers have read-only access.

2. **Database Design:**

   - Update the database schema to store information about project collaborators.
   - Create a separate table to manage relationships between users and projects.

3. **UI/UX:**
   - Design an intuitive interface indicating who is working on the project.
   - Implement real-time updates to reflect changes made by collaborators instantly.

## Amazon S3 Integration:

### Step 1: Create an S3 Bucket

1. **Sign in to AWS Console:**

   - Navigate to the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/).

2. **Create an S3 Bucket:**
   - In the S3 service, create a new bucket and configure its settings.

### Step 2: Get AWS Access Keys

1. **IAM Console:**

   - Access the IAM service in the AWS Console.

2. **Create Access Keys:**
   - Generate access keys for an IAM user with S3 access.

### Step 3: Install AWS SDK

Install the AWS SDK for JavaScript/Node.js:

```bash
npm install aws-sdk
```

### Step 4: Update Project Code

1. **Require AWS SDK:**

   - Import the AWS SDK in your project.

   ```javascript
   const AWS = require("aws-sdk");
   ```

2. **Configure AWS SDK:**

   - Set the AWS credentials and region.

   ```javascript
   AWS.config.update({
     accessKeyId: "your-access-key",
     secretAccessKey: "your-secret-access-key",
     region: "your-region",
   });
   ```

3. **Perform S3 Operations:**

   - Use the `AWS.S3` object to perform S3 operations.

   ```javascript
   const s3 = new AWS.S3();

   // Example: Upload a file
   await s3
     .upload({
       Bucket: "your-bucket-name",
       Key: "your-object-key",
       Body: "path/to/local/file",
     })
     .promise();
   ```

## Additional Considerations:

- **Security:**
  - Handle credentials securely, preferably using environment variables.
- **Error Handling:**
  - Implement proper error handling for storage operations.
- **Optimizations:**
  - Optimize for performance, such as parallel uploads/downloads for large files.
